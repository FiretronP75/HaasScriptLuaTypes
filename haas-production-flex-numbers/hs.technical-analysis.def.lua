---                             Look for breakouts outside these bands, while also using the shorter time frames
---                             to define likely support and resistance levels at the lower and upper Acceleration Bands. This indicator is usually plotted on the price chart.

--- Accumulation/Distribution Line (AD) Developed by Marc Chaikin, the Accumulation Distribution
--- Line is a volume-based indicator designed to measure the cumulative flow of money into and out of a security. Chaikin
--- originally referred to the indicator as the Cumulative Money Flow Line. As with cumulative indicators, the Accumulation
--- Distribution Line is a running total of each period's Money Flow Volume. First, a multiplier is calculated based on the
--- relationship of the close to the high-low range. Second, the Money Flow Multiplier is multiplied by the period's volume
--- to come up with a Money Flow Volume. A running total of the Money Flow Volume forms the Accumulation Distribution Line. This indicator is usually plotted to its own chart.

--- The Beta (BETA) value can measure he volatility of a coin in relation to that of the market.
--- For stock investors the beta value[1] of a portfolio is an important measure of risk, a value above 1 means the
--- investment is more volatile than the market, a value lower than 1 is less volatile.
--- It can be helpful to do a beta analysis for your portfolio to see how returns match up against the beta and
--- spot real winners (low beta, high returns). Since most altcoins are still sold and bought using Bitcoin (BTC),

--- The Choppiness Index, designed by E.W. Dreiss, is an indicator which is directionless. This means it doesn't show the market direction,
---                             rather reflects whether the market is choppy (trades sideways) or smooth (trending). The general way of interpreting
---                             this index is that higher values mean the market is choppy, while lower values equal directional movement.

--- straightforward indicator; the concepts are easy to understand and the signals are well-defined.

--- The Keltner Channel (KELTNER), originally developed by Chester Keltner, extended by Linda Bradford Raschke,
--- uses a volatility-based envelopes set above and below an exponential moving average.
--- This indicator is similar to Bollinger Bands, which use the standard deviation (STDDEV)
--- to set the bands. Instead of using the standard deviation, Keltner Channels use
--- the Average True Range (ATR) to set channel width. The channels are typically
--- set 2x ATR values above and below the EMA. The exponential
--- moving average dictates direction and the Average True Range sets channel width.
--- Keltner Channels are a trend following indicator used to identify reversals with

--- overbought and oversold levels when the market is ranging. This indicator is usually plotted on the price chart.

--- Know Sure Thing (KST), developed by Martin Pring, is a momentum oscillator based on the smoothed
--- Rate-of-Change (ROC) for four different periods. In short, KST measures price momentum for four different price cycles, combining

--- often, Pring notes that such breaks reinforce signal line crossovers. This indicator is usually plotted on its own chart.

--- The Mesa Adaptive Moving Average (MAMA) is a trend-following

--- This method of adaptation features a fast and a slow moving average so that the composite moving average swiftly responds to price
--- changes and holds the average value until the next bar’s close. 
--- The Averages act as support and resistance areas and the price will tend to react to them.

--- The Money Flow Index (MFI), developed by Gene Quong and Avrum Soudack,
--- is an oscillator that uses both price and volume to measure buying and selling pressure.
--- MFI is also known as volume-weighted RSI. MFI starts with the typical price for each period.
--- Money flow is positive when the typical price rises (buying pressure) and negative when the
--- typical price declines (selling pressure). A ratio of positive and negative money flow is
--- then plugged into an RSI formula to create an oscillator that moves between zero and one hundred.
--- As a momentum oscillator tied to volume, MFI is best suited to identify reversals and price
--- extremes with a variety of signals.

--- Time Series Forecast (TSF) is a linear

--- The UpDown RSI (UDRSI) is an RSI Based Indicator that uses

--- step up. Because of this alternative calculation of Relative Strength Index, Up Down RSI

--- The Ultimate Oscillator (ULTOSC), developed by Larry Williams,
--- is a momentum oscillator designed to capture momentum across three different timeframes.
--- The multiple timeframe objective seeks to avoid the pitfalls of other oscillators. Many
--- momentum oscillators surge at the beginning of a strong advance, only to form a bearish
--- divergence as the advance continues. This is because they are stuck with one timeframe.
--- The Ultimate Oscillator attempts to correct this fault by incorporating longer timeframes
--- into the basic formula. Williams identified a buy signal a based on a bullish divergence
--- and a sell signal based on a bearish divergence.

--- The Zero-Lag Exponential Moving Average (ZLEMA), developed by John Ehlers and Ric Way.

--- indicators which average a price over time. The idea is do a regular exponential moving average (EMA) calculation
